# Introduction
This module is about the data collection, where we will discuss about how we collect
the data, process the data and store them. We will do a brief overview of some tools
(both proprietary and open source) that will help in the process. The type of data
collected is dependent on the HBIM dimensions.

For the first three dimension of the data, which are the three spatial dimension
for which we will need to survey the actual location and build 3D model out of it.
The two most common techniques are terrestrial laser scanning, TLS and photogrammetry
using unmanned aerial vehicle UAV.

The other dimensions require data collection from other sources, such as organizations
like Archaeological Survey of India, private parties and stakeholders in the subject
cultural heritage. We go brief into such data collection.

At the end, we will discuss how the above was applied while collecting the data
for Rajarani HBIM. In summary, the module will cover the following,

- Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS)
- Photogrammetry using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
- Other data collection sources
- Proprietary and open source software for data processing
- Case study of the above for Rajarani.

Along with legal, technical and non-technical challenges for the above mentioned
parts of this module.
