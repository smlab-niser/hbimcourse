## About
The data for Rajarani was collected in the year 2021 for the purpose of preservation,
and protection of the Rajarani and Lingaraj through a digital twin in the form of
Heritage Building Information modeling and a semantic web of knowledge in the form
of various HBIM dimensions.

The following data was collected using 

- Terresterial Laser Scan
- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle

and it was processed into the following,

- Highly detailed 3D polygon mesh including textures.
- 3D point cloud
- High resolution photographs of the temples
- The temple in virtual reality for Oculus HMD.
- 2D ground and elevation plans

And was collected into a HBIM and semantic web of knowledge using the techinques
as described in this course.

The technical paper for this entire project can be found [here]().
