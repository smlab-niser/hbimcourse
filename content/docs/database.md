# Setting up the database

There are many robust database management systems available like MySQL, MariaDB,
Oracle. But since we are only going to use open source tools, we will use
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org). PostgreSQL is based on relational database
model and the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations are done using the
Structured Query Language (SQL).

## Getting the database
The official binary releases and source code can be found on at
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org), which should be the preferred method of
installing the database software on Windows and Mac OS X. For Linux-based operating
systems, the package manager should be preferred.
